              <b>What is a hackathon?</b><br/>
              Hackathons are events where students across the country come together for a weekend of innovation and creativity. Participants at VandyHacks have 36 hours to create anything that shows off their creativity and passion! You may choose any platform, programming language, or format to show off to our judges - you can even present a storyboard or an idea! At VandyHacks, there&apos;s no end to the possibilities.

              <b>What if I&apos;ve never been to a hackathon?</b><br/>
              Not to worry! A few days before the event, you&apos;ll receive an email with a link to our hacker guide, which will contain all the information you need. During the event, our team will be available to answer any questions. As always, feel free to email us at info@vandyhacks.org if you have any questions!
